About
======

Dimmer lets you reduce your screen brightness below the level that Android allows. It's very helpful to avoid eye strain when using the phone in the night.
The app has a minimalist interface to keep things sweet and simple. The background service has negligible battery and memory consumption and runs only when it is turned ON.
It works by creating an always-on-top translucent overlay, when ON. It does not mess around with your phone's brightness settings in any way.

Features :
- Widget for one-touch operation
- Timer to turn off service automatically
- Turn off option in Notification
